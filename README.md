# Uniswap v4 Indexer

Uniswap v4 indexer built with [Envio](https://envio.dev) that can be used by any developer to power their infrastructure.

_Please refer to the [documentation website](https://docs.envio.dev) for a thorough guide on all [Envio](https://envio.dev) indexer features_

Please note this Indexer is being bootstrapped as a multichain indexer based off this Uniswap V4 Indexer: https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-subgraph
Pricing (especially!!) and many other features are thanks to the team who built the above mentioned Indexer.

**Note:** This indexer currently powers [v4.xyz](https://v4.xyz), the hub for Uniswap data and hooks.

## Overview

This indexer is currently a WIP that tracks key metrics and events from Uniswap v4 pools and can be used to:

- Track pool statistics (volume, TVL, fees, etc.)
- Monitor swaps and liquidity changes
- Power analytics dashboards and trading interfaces
- Build custom notifications and alerts

We are also in the process of including Hook features.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

### Running the Indexer

Start the indexer with:

```

### Accessing Data

Once the indexer is running, you can view and query all indexed data at:
